After many challenges, I have decided to start a Ph.D. journey at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I am looking forward to everything I will learn, meet, and experience there. 
Thank everyone who has supported and cared for me, especially I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Jiyong Kim. 
I couldn't have achieved this without your support. Thank you.
