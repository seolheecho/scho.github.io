The paper that I firstly wrote at CMU has been published in Computers and Chemical Engineering Journal! The title of this paper is *Recent advances and challenges in optimization models for expansion planning of power systems and reliability optimization*. In this paper, I have reviewed many previous papers regarding expansion planning of power systems in terms of their modeling, solution method, reliability/flexibility.
