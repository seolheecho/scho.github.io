I took my Ph.D. qualifying exam on August 26, and today I officially received a letter from the department that I passed the exam! I am glad that I've been recognized for my hard work last summer. Thank all of you who have helped me to achieve this accomplishment and especially thanks my advisor, Ignacio E. Grossmann, for his patience and support.
