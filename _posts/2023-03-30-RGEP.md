My first research paper on expansion planning of reliable power generation systems has finally been published. The title of this work is *Disjunctive optimization model and algorithm for long-term capacity expansion planning of reliable power generation systems*. Many thanks to Professor Javier Tovar-Facio and Ignacio Grossmann for their persistent support and feedback. Check the paper out [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135423001138).
