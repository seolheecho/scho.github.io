When my first research paper was published and someone cited it, I was thrilled by the fact that my research could be of help to someone. I made a commitment at that moment to conduct research that could assist more people and set a specific goal of reaching 300 citations. Today, I have finally achieved that goal. While 300 citations may not mean much to some, it is a source of joy for me as it acknowledges my efforts over the past years. I will continue to study and work diligently to write even better papers in the future. Thank you.
