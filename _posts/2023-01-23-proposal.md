Today, I took my Ph.D. proposal exam and successfully passed it! :satisfied: The title of my presentation is *Disjunctive optimization model and algorithm for long-term capacity expansion planning of reliable power generation systems*. I am so happy that I finished this stressful task. I truly appreciate my advisor (Professor Ignacio E. Grossmann) for his encouragement, support, and guidance. Only one last thing left!
