## About me
Hello there! I'm Seolhee Cho, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Chemical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), specializing in Process Systems Engineering (PSE). Under the guidance of Professor [Ignacio E. Grossmann](http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/), my research focuses on developing an innovative optimization model and algorithm for multi-period and multi-region power system expansion planning. The primary goal is to incorporate reliability, resilience, and flexibility into the expansion planning model. In the initial phase of my work, I successfully developed a disjunctive optimization model and bilevel decomposition to plan reliable infrastructure of power generation systems. Currently, I'm dedicated to proposing a new expansion planning model that enhances the resilience of power systems.

Before joining CMU, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Energy and Chemical Engineering from Incheon National University (INU), South Korea, where I advised by  Professor [Jiyong Kim](https://jkimlab.wixsite.com/ipse). During my time at INU, I had performed multiples projects related to methanol process synthesis, biomass-based infrastructure deployment, and software development. 


## Research Interests
I am highly interested in learning and utilizing: 
 - Mixed-integer programming (MIP), Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP), Stochastic programming (SP)
 - Data-driven and machine-learning based optimization
 - Benders decomposition, Lagrangean decomposition, Bilevel decomposition
 - Exogenous/endogenous uncertainty
 - Energy systesm, Sustainability, Carbon-neutrality
 - Process synthesis, Techno-economic analysis, Life-cycle analysis

Please check my CV for more information on my previous and current work.
