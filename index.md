# About me
I'm Seolhee Cho, a third-year Ph.D. candidate studying Process Systems Engineering (PSE) in the department of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). My research, supervised by Professor [Ignacio E. Grossmann](http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/), focuses on developing an innovative optimization model and algorithm for multi-period and multi-region expansion planning of power systems. The main objective is to integrate reliability, resilience, and flexibility into the expansion planning model. In the initial phase of my work, I successfully created a disjunctive optimization model and bilevel decomposition for planning of reliable power generation systems. Currently, my efforts are concentrated on proposing a new expansion planning model that can enhance power system resilience.
