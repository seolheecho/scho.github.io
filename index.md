# About me
Hello, I'm Seolhee Cho and a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the department of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) under the guidance of Professor [Ignacio E. Grossmann](http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/). I have been developing optimization models for power systems using different programming such as Mixed-integer programming, Generalized Disjunctive Programming, and stochastic programming. I have also proposed decomposition algorithms to improve computational tractability of large-scale optimization problems. 

The ultimate goal of my current projects is to
