Hello there! I'm Seolhee Cho, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Under the guidance of Professor [Ignacio E. Grossmann](http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/) in the area of Process Systems Engineering (PSE), my research focuses on developing an innovative optimization model and algorithm for multi-period and multi-region expansion planning of power system. The primary goal is to incorporate reliability, resilience, and flexibility into the expansion planning model. In the initial phase of my work, I successfully developed Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) optimization model and bilevel decomposition with tailored cuts for planning of reliable power generation systems. Currently, I'm dedicated to proposing a new expansion planning model that can enhance both power system resilience and reliability.

Before joining CMU, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Energy and Chemical Engineering from Incheon National University (INU), South Korea, where I advised by Professor [Jiyong Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/ipsekimgroup). During my time at INU, I had performed multiples projects such as methanol process synthesis, energy system evaluation, biomass-to-energy infrastructure deployment, and software development. 




## Research Interests
I am highly interested in learning and utilizing: 
 - Mixed-integer programming (MIP), Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP), Stochastic programming (SP)
 - Data-driven and machine-learning based optimization
 - Benders decomposition, Lagrangean decomposition, Bilevel decomposition
 - Exogenous/endogenous uncertainty including reliability, resilience, and flexibility
 - Energy systems, Sustainability, Carbon-neutrality
 - Process synthesis, Techno-economic analysis, Life-cycle analysis

Please check my [CV](/assets/pdf/cho.pdf) for more information on my previous and current works.
