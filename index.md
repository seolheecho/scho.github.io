Iâ€™m Seolhee Cho and a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the department of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working in Process Systems Engineering (PSE) under the quidance of Professor [Ignacio E. Grossmann](http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/). The goal of my works is to propose a novel optimization model and decomposition algorithm for multi-period expansion planning of reliable and resilient power systems.
